      <p>This project explores the way how common data science methods can be applied on data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. The basis for the data were the counts of the most common amenities like restaurant, cafe, etc. (specified with <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity">Key:amenity</a>) found on the various buildings and elements in OpenStreetMap. The interactive visualization is done with <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet.js</a>.</p>
      <p>You can switch bellow between viewing the amenities per capita for each region or a logistic regression trained on two countries (e.g. Germany and France denoted as DEFR). The trained logistic regression model is then applied to other regions to show similarities between the two classified countries.</p>
